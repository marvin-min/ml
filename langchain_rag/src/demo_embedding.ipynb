      "Llamas belong to the family Camelidae, which includes several species of even-toed ungulates (hoofed mammals). Their closest living relatives are:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Alpacas**: Like llamas, alpacas are domesticated South American camelids, known for their soft wool and gentle nature.\n",
      "2. **Camels** (Dromedary and Bactrian): As you might expect, camels are also part of the Camelidae family. They're famous for their distinctive humps, which store fat for energy during long periods without water.\n",
      "3. **Guanacos**: These wild South American camelids are closely related to llamas and alpacas. They're often considered a \"wild\" or \"feral\" ancestor of domesticated llama populations.\n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of evolutionary relationships, llamas share a common ancestor with camels around 40-50 million years ago. This ancestral species is thought to have originated in North America before migrating to South America and evolving into the various camelid species we see today.\n",
      "\n",
